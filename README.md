This assignment is to demostrate your knowledge of loops and looping in your programming. This assignment will be worth 100 points with a possible 25 extra points.

The assignments are:

Use a while loop and print "Look at me loopin" to the console 6 times. (25pts.)

{ 

code to run 

}

Use a for loop to print "They see me loopin" 4 times to the console. (25pts.)

Use a Do-While loop to print "Why you loopin?" to the console 7 times (25pts.)

EXTRA CREDIT: Use a loop to find the QB1's average passing yards per game. (25pts.)
HINT: you access an item in an array with the syntax item = qb1PassingYards[index]; -- where index would be the control variable from your loop
